# TaskMaker Dashboard

This project replicates a clean, modern dashboard interface as per the design shared. It consists of three major components built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/jQuery — without any UI libraries — to showcase pixel-perfect front-end skills.

Welcome to the **TaskMaker Dashboard** – a modern, responsive admin dashboard UI built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript (with jQuery)**. This layout features a collapsible sidebar, project overview cards, a schedule planner, user tasks, and a right-side performance panel – all inspired by clean and professional UI/UX practices.

# Technologies Used

- HTML5 – Semantic structure

- CSS3 – Custom styling with gradients, box shadows, and rounded UI

- JavaScript/jQuery – (If interactivity required later)

- Google Fonts – Optional for typography enhancements
